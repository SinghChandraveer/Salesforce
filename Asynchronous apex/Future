Methods with the future annotation must be static methods,can only return a void type.
The specified parameters must be primitive data types, arrays of primitive data types, or collections of primitive data types. 
Methods with the future annotation cannot take sObjects or objects as arguments.
You can invoke future methods the same way you invoke any other method. However, a future method canâ€™t invoke another future method.
Asynchronous calls, such as @future or executeBatch, called in a startTest, stopTest block, do not count against your limits for the number of queued jobs.



global class FutureClass
{
    @future
    public static void myFutureMethod()
    {   
         // Perform some operations
    }
}
