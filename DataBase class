DMLOptions Class

DmlOptions Properties :

    allowFieldTruncation  : Specifies the truncation behavior of large strings.
    assignmentRuleHeader  : Specifies the assignment rule to be used when creating a case or lead.
    emailHeader           : Specifies additional information regarding the automatic email that gets sent when an events occurs.
    localeOptions         : Specifies the language of any labels that are returned by Apex.
    optAllOrNone          : Specifies whether the operation allows for partial success.

++++++++++++++++++++
DmlOptions.AssignmentRuleHeader // Runs/Not_Run the assignment rule while performing DML operation on CASE/LEAD

                    1. assignmentRuleID : Specifies the ID of a specific assignment rule to run for the case or lead. The assignment rule can be active or inactive.(The ID can be retrieved by querying the AssignmentRule sObject.)
                    2. useDefaultRule   : If specified as 'true' for a case or lead, the system uses the default (active) assignment rule for the case or lead.
    
        Database.DMLOptions dmo = new Database.DMLOptions();
        dmo.assignmentRuleHeader.useDefaultRule= true;  OR dmo.assignmentRuleHeader.assignmentRuleId= '01QD0000000EqAn';
        Lead l = new Lead(company='ABC', lastname='Smith');

        l.setOptions(dmo); insert l;
    OR
        Database.insert(l,dmo);
    
++++++++++++++++++++
DMLOptions.DuplicateRuleHeader  // Allow/Not_Allow to save duplicate record

                    1. allowSave        : Set to true to save the duplicate record. Set to false to prevent the duplicate record from being saved.
                    2. runAsCurrentUser : Set to 'true' to make sure that sharing rules for the current user are enforced when duplicate rules run.
                                          Set to 'false' to use the sharing rules specified in the class for the request. 
                                          If no sharing rules are specified, Apex code runs in system context and sharing rules for the current user are not enforced.
                                          


          Database.DMLOptions dml = new Database.DMLOptions(); 
          dml.DuplicateRuleHeader.allowSave = true;
          dml.DuplicateRuleHeader.runAsCurrentUser = true;
          Account duplicateAccount = new Account(Name='dupe');
          Database.SaveResult sr = Database.insert(duplicateAccount, dml);
          if (sr.isSuccess()) {
            System.debug('Duplicate account has been inserted in Salesforce!');
          }

++++++++++++++++++++
DmlOptions.EmailHeader // Even though auto-sent emails can be triggered by actions in the Salesforce user interface, the DMLOptions settings for emailHeader take effect only for DML operations carried out in Apex code.

                        The Salesforce user interface allows you to specify whether or not to send an email when the following events occur:
                              Creation of a new case or task
                              Conversion of a case email to a contact
                              New user email notification
                              Lead queue email notification
                              Password reset
                        In Apex saved against API version 15.0 or later, the Database.DMLOptions emailHeader property enables you to specify additional information regarding the email that gets sent when one of the events occurs because of Apex DML code execution.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SaveResult Class :

  Database.SaveResult[] srList = Database.insert(acc_list, false);
  for (Database.SaveResult sr : srList) {
    if (sr.isSuccess()) {

==============================================================================================================================================
Transaction Control
    Database.setSavepoint() is used to define a point at which DML operations can be rolled back. 
    If any error occurs during DML Operations, that contains many statements, the application will be rolled back to the most recent save point 
    and the entire transaction will not be aborted.


                                                            Savepoint sp = Database.setSavepoint();;

                                                            Account a = new Account();
                                                            a.Name='1';
                                                            a.AccountNumber = '2';
                                                            insert a;

                                                            Contact c = new Contact(Account = a.Id);
                                                            try
                                                            {
                                                                insert c;
                                                            }
                                                            catch(Exception e)
                                                            {
                                                                Database.RollBack(sp);
                                                            }

        If you set more than one savepoint, then roll back to a savepoint that is not the last savepoint you generated, the later savepoint variables become invalid. 
        For example, if you generated savepoint SP1 first, savepoint SP2 after that, and then you rolled back to SP1, the variable SP2 would no longer be valid. 
        You will receive a runtime error if you try to use it.
        
        References to savepoints cannot cross trigger invocations because each trigger invocation is a new trigger context. 
        If you declare a savepoint as a static variable then try to use it across trigger contexts, you will receive a run-time error.
        
        Each savepoint you set counts against the governor limit for DML statements.
        Each rollback counts against the governor limit for DML statements. You will receive a runtime error if you try to rollback the database additional times.
        
        Static variables are not reverted during a rollback. If you try to run the trigger again, the static variables retain the values from the first run.

        
        The ID on an sObject inserted after setting a savepoint is not cleared after a rollback. 
        Create an sObject to insert after a rollback. Attempting to insert the sObject using the variable created before the rollback fails because the sObject variable has an ID. 
        Updating or upserting the sObject using the same variable also fails because the sObject is not in the database and, thus, cannot be updated.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Locking Statements :
    use "FOR UPDATE" to lock sObject records while they’re being updated in order to prevent other transactions to happen on same record.
    While an sObject record is locked, no other client or user is allowed to make updates either through code or the Salesforce user interface. The lock gets released when the transaction completes.
    
Account [] accts = [SELECT Id FROM Account LIMIT 2 FOR UPDATE];

        If you attempt to lock a record currently locked by another client, your process waits a maximum of 10 seconds for the lock to be released before acquiring a new lock.
        If the wait time exceeds 10 seconds, a QueryException is thrown. 
        Similarly, if you attempt to update a record currently locked by another client and the lock isn’t released within a maximum of 10 seconds, a DmlException is thrown.
