Lightning Data Service manages data for you; changes to a record are reflected in all the technologies built on it. 
Contrastingly, data from Apex is not managed; you must refresh the data.

If Lightning Data Service detects a change to a record or any data or metadata it supports, 
all components using a relevant @wire adapter receive the new value. The detection is triggered if:

A Lightning web component mutates the record.
The LDS cache entry expires and then a Lightning web componentâ€™s @wire triggers a read. 
The cache entry and the Lightning web component must be in the same browser and app (for example Lightning Experience) for the same user.

Lightning Data Service does a lot of work to make code perform well.
    Loads record data progressively.
    Caches results on the client.
    Invalidates cache entries when dependent Salesforce data and metadata changes.
    Optimizes server calls by bulkifying and deduping requests.

Lightning Data Service is built on top of User Interface API(UI API). UI API responses also respect CRUD access, field-level security settings, and sharing settings.
